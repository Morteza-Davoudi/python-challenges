# Guess the Number ðŸŽ®

Welcome to the "Guess the Number" challenge! In this project, the program will generate a random number between **1 and 100**, and the user has to guess the number.

For each guess, the program will inform the user whether the guessed number is too **high**, **low**, or **correct**. The goal is to guess the number with the least number of tries.

## ðŸ“œ How to Play
1. The program will randomly select a number between **1 and 100**.
2. The user enters their guess.
3. The program will tell the user if their guess is **too high**, **too low**, or **correct**.
4. The game continues until the correct number is guessed.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
No special setup is required! Just run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python guess-game/guess-game.py
